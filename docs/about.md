# About This Project

**Senior Support Hub** is a living knowledge base that demonstrates how modern documentation practices—structured authoring, automation, and AI-assisted content workflows—can make complex public services easier to navigate.

This project began as part of a professional Capstone initiative exploring how *AI can accelerate and enhance traditional technical writing processes*. It uses a real-world example—renewing an Irish driving licence online—to illustrate how documentation can evolve from static text to intelligent, dynamic, and continuously improving guidance.

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. **Simplify essential eldercare workflows**  
   Transform long, confusing online processes (like NDLS licence renewals) into step-by-step, human-centred guides.

2. **Demonstrate modern docs-as-code principles**  
   Manage documentation like software using GitHub, Markdown, and MkDocs Material.

3. **Showcase AI transformation potential**  
   Use AI to automate linting, style conformance, metadata tagging, and quality audits aligned to the IBM Style Guide.

4. **Enable future reuse and scalability**  
   Provide a foundation that can expand to other government and eldercare processes (medical cards, utility management, etc.).

## 🧭 How the Site Is Structured

All content lives under the `/docs` directory:

| Folder | Purpose |
|---------|----------|
| `/concepts/` | High-level overviews and contextual information |
| `/tasks/` | Step-by-step procedural topics |
| `/reference/` | Data, file-type, or system reference information |
| `/about.md` | This file — project purpose and roadmap |

Each Markdown file represents a modular content unit that can be improved, audited, or transformed individually through AI workflows.

## 💡 Author’s Note

This site forms part of an ongoing exploration of how AI and technical communication intersect—how we can blend empathy, structure, and automation to serve real human needs.  
The **Senior Support Hub** is not an official government resource; it’s an independent educational and proof-of-concept project.
