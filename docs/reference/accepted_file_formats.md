# File Upload Requirements

## Overview
When uploading supporting documents—such as medical or eyesight reports—to the NDLS portal, files must meet the following criteria.

## Accepted File Types
| File Type | Description | Typical Use |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| PDF | Portable Document Format | Most official documents and scanned reports |
| JPG | JPEG Image | Photos or scanned forms |
| PNG | Portable Network Graphics | High-quality scanned images |

## File Size and Quality
- Maximum file size: **5 MB per document**  
- Each file must be **clearly legible** and display the applicant’s **full name and date of examination**.  
- Avoid photos with glare or shadows that obscure details.

## Security Tip
Do not include your PPS number, full signature, or other sensitive identifiers unless explicitly required on the official form.
