# About renewing your driving license online

The National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) lets eligible drivers renew their Irish driving license online using their MyGovID account.

## Who can use it
You can usually renew online if:

- You already hold an Irish driving license
- Your NDLS and MyGovID details match
- You do **not** need an in-person eyesight/medical test on the day

If NDLS needs extra proof, the portal will ask you to upload it.

## What you need
- Verified **MyGovID**
- Current/most recent license number
- Medical/eyesight reports (if required)
- Digital copies in an accepted file format  
See: **Medical and eyesight report requirements**.

## What the flow contains
1. Sign in with MyGovID  
2. Confirm personal details  
3. Select **Renew my driving license** and categories  
4. Complete the medical questionnaire  
5. Upload supporting documents  
6. Accept declarations  
7. Pay (if fee applies)

See also: **Vehicle categories**.

## When you can’t continue online
If you answer **Yes** to some medical questions, NDLS may pause the application until you upload a doctor’s report.
