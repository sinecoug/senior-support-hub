# Uploading a medical report
**Short description:** Upload a doctor’s or optician’s report to finish your NDLS online driving-license renewal.

## Before you begin
Make sure you have:

- Completed **Medical** or **Eyesight** report signed by a practitioner  
- Clear digital copy (PDF, JPG, or PNG)  
- NDLS reference number or saved renewal  

## Context
If you answered **Yes** to certain health questions, NDLS pauses the renewal and asks you to upload a report.  
You can do this immediately or by returning to a saved renewal.

## Steps
1. Sign in to the NDLS portal with **MyGovID**.  
   - If resuming, choose **Return to saved renewal**.  
2. Locate **Upload medical report**. NDLS shows which report type is needed.  
3. Select **Choose file** and upload your document.  
   > **Tip:** Accepted formats: PDF, JPG, PNG.  
4. Select **Submit**.  
   > **Note:** A green confirmation banner confirms the upload.  
5. Review declarations and select **Continue**.

## Result
The report attaches to your application, and you can proceed with payment and confirmation.

## What to do next
- If NDLS later requests an updated report, repeat this procedure.
