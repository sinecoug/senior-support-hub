# Obtaining a Medical or Eyesight Report

## About This Task
Before you can renew your driving licence online, you may need to obtain a medical or eyesight report.  
These reports confirm that you meet the health and vision standards required by the NDLS.

## Prerequisites
- Access to a printer or the ability to download PDF forms from the [NDLS website](https://www.ndls.ie/).
- Your **PPS number** and **current driving licence number**.
- A GP or optometrist registered to complete and certify your report.

> **Note:** Applicants aged **70 or over** must always submit a valid medical report.

## Procedure
1. **Download the relevant form:**
   - Medical Report Form (**D501**)  
   - Eyesight Report Form (**D502**)  
   from the [NDLS website](https://www.ndls.ie/).

2. **Print the form or email it to your GP/optometrist.**
   > If your doctor or optometrist uses electronic forms, ensure it matches the official NDLS version.

3. **Attend your appointment.**
   - Your doctor or optometrist will complete the form.
   - Verify that your **full name**, **date of examination**, and **signature** are clearly shown.

4. **Check the form validity.**
   - The report must be dated **within one month** of your licence renewal application.

5. **Scan or photograph the completed report.**
   - Save it in one of the **accepted formats** (see [File Upload Requirements](../reference/file-upload-requirements.md)).

6. **Keep the file ready to upload.**
   - You will be asked to attach it during the “Supporting Documentation” stage of your renewal.

## Results
You now have a valid digital copy of your medical or eyesight report that meets NDLS format and timing requirements.  
You can proceed to upload the file when prompted in the renewal process.
