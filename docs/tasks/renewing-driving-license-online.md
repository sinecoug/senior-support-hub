# Renewing your driving license online

**Short description:** Renew your Irish driving license through the NDLS online portal using your MyGovID credentials.

---

## Before you begin
Make sure you have:

- A verified **MyGovID** account  
- Your most recent driving license number  
- Any required medical or eyesight report (scanned and ready to upload)  
- Proof of address and residency (if prompted)

See:  
- [About NDLS online renewal](concept-ndls-online-renewal.md) for an overview of the process.

## Context
This procedure describes the standard NDLS online renewal flow for customers who already hold an Irish driving license.  
The flow includes: login → personal details → additional details → medical questionnaire → document upload → declaration → payment.

Depending on your answers, NDLS may ask you to upload additional documents.

## Steps

1. **Go to the NDLS website** and select **Apply online**.  
   - You are redirected to the MyGovID sign-in page.  
   - If you do not have an account, follow the link to create one and return to NDLS.

2. **Sign in with your MyGovID** email and password, and enter the 6-digit verification code sent to your phone.  
   > **Tip:** If you don’t receive the code, select **Resend code**.

3. **Review your personal details.**  
   > **Caution:** If the address shown for MyGovID and NDLS differ, update them before submitting.

4. **Select “Renew my driving license”** and confirm your vehicle categories.  
   - NDLS may remind you that eyesight or medical reports could be required.  
   - For details about categories, see [Vehicle categories](reference-ndls-vehicle-categories.md).

5. **Complete the Medical Questionnaire.**  
   - There are up to 26 questions. Answer truthfully.  
   - Some answers may trigger a request for a medical report.  
   - See [Uploading a medical report](uploading-medical-report.md) if that happens.

6. **Upload any supporting documents NDLS requests.**  
   - Accepted formats: PDF, JPG, PNG.  
   - For accepted formats and who completes the reports, see [Medical and eyesight report requirements](reference-ndls-medical-docs.md).  
   - You can pause and return later using [Returning to a saved renewal](returning-to-saved-renewal.md).

7. **Review the declarations** and accept the terms.

8. **Pay the renewal fee (if applicable)** and submit.  
   > **Note:** Some applicants (for example, older drivers) may see **No fee**.
